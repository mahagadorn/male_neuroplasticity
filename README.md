#male_neuroplasticity

This repository was created to document code for a neuroplasticity project on  sweat bee and bumble bee males. The code was referenced in the manuscript and all data can be found on dryad.

##Species one: Megalopta genalis

The analysis: Mgenalis_MNP_StructureVolumeAnalysis--This is a rmarkdown file that will import data (set up as an R project and data being stored in "Data" folder under root directory), calculate proportion data from raw values, and run statistical analyses. A new csv will be generated along with a pdf.

##Species two: Bombus impatiens

The analysis: Bimpatiens_MNP_StructureVolumeAnalysis--This is a rmarkdown file that will import data (set up as an R project and data being stored in "Data" folder under root directory), calculate proportion data from raw values, and run statistical analyses. A new csv will be generated along with a pdf.

##Figures: MNP_Figures.R 
This R script will import the output files generated above and create figures.
